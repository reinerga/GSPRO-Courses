Alpin offers some of the finest amenities available at a semi-private facility in the area. Access to the club is easy, we’re on the north side of the QEW at Bronte Rd (Hwy 25).

Alpin offers almost any golf amenity that you can think of at a golf course. Start your day with a bucket of balls, followed by some practice putting on our huge practice green. If you’ve got a few minutes before your tee time, maybe a reasonably priced breakfast is in order.

During your round you may want to ride in one of our modern gas powered golf carts with sun roof. On appropriate days, you can expect a visit from our refreshment cart while on the course. Finally, enjoy a drink in our licensed facility as you tally your scores and prepare your war stories.  

Our fully equipped Golf Shop is staffed by helpful CPGA Professionals and can assist you with everything from the choice of a golf glove to a personalized club fitting.
